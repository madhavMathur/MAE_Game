# The game for Mad About Environment

I have created 4 python files:
**1. GameManager** - This will be the main class that handles the game loop
**2. Player** - This will be the class for the Player
**3. Enemy** - This will be the class for the Enemy
**4. Collection** - This will hold our collectible garbage

Additionally, you will find some dummy images for Player, Enemies, and Collections. We will modify them later as per the need. There is also a maze image that we can use for prototyping.
